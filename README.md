# Adjustable Low EMI Switching Power Supply
A power supply is an essential tool on every electronics bench. The TPS54202 is a highly efficient 2A synchronous buck converter with a wide 28V input voltage range and low EMI figures, making it suitable for various applications. These features make the TPS54202 an excellent choice for building a power supply.

To achieve a low noise level and ensure high performance, I implemented a variety of input and output filters, along with following several PCB design techniques. The chip operates at a switching frequency of 500KHz and is equipped with internal loop compensation. Setting up the power supply is simpleâ€”just connect the input to a step-down AC transformer (e.g., 220V to 15V) and use a multiturn potentiometer to adjust the output voltage to your desired level.
